### My Story 📖

Most of the projects I work on involve a mix of understanding what already exists and building something new on top of it. I spend time reading through existing code, figuring out how things fit together, and then adding or improving features in a way that doesn’t break what’s already there.

I enjoy full-stack work because I like seeing the whole picture - how a screen someone clicks connects to the logic behind it and how data moves through the system. I often split large features into smaller pieces so the code is easier to follow, change, and debug later.

I also don’t like repeating the same manual steps again and again. If something feels fragile or time-consuming, I try to automate it so it’s more reliable and easier to maintain.

Recently, I’ve been exploring data and AI-related ideas in a careful way. I test things, question whether they actually help, and keep them only if they make the system better. I care more about usefulness than fancy demos.

This GitHub reflects that balance. Some projects focus on building new features, others on improving existing ones, and some are experiments. Together, they show how I think through problems and grow over time.

### How I Like to Work 🌱

- I try to keep code easy to read and reason about  
- I balance improving existing code with building new features  
- I automate tasks that feel repetitive or error-prone  
- I think about whether someone else can understand the code later

### Why This GitHub Exists

I use this space to build, improve, and experiment.  
Not everything here is polished - and that’s intentional.
